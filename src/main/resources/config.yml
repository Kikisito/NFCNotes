# [!] This is IMPORTANT if you already have notes created, and you want to change any value of this category.
# [!] Remember that if you change any of these options and *a plugin* is using your old notes,
# [!] these must be changed or newer notes won't work on that plugin.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Available placeholders for name and lore: {money}, {issuer}
# If you use any plugin that requires notes to be identical like Shopkeepers, you can remove the {issuer}
# placeholder.

# If you want to change the material, check https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# For enchantments check https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html
# If you set a material that does not appear on these lists the plugin may break.
